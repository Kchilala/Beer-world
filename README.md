# Assignment 2

## Justification

### Task 2: Data Preparation
- **What is UTF?**
- UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. It is a character encoding standard that assigns unique numerical values, 
- called code points, to every character in the Unicode standard. 
- **Why setting the format of a file is important when reading or writing it?**
- UTF encoding standards are essential for ensuring that text can be accurately represented, 
- exchanged, and displayed in a globalized and digital world, regardless of the language or script used. 
- This universality and consistency make Unicode a fundamental component of modern computing and communication.

### Task 3: Data Exploration
- **What can cause the mean to not be reliable measure?**
- The mean may not be reliable if there are extreme values (outliers) that significantly skew the average, 
- giving a false representation of the data
- **What other statistic can you use to avoid this pitfall?**
- You can use the median instead of the mean to avoid the impact of outliers. 
- The median is the middle value when data is arranged in order, and it's not affected by extreme values.

### Task 4: Further Analyzes
Document your functions here. In particular:
- Problem to solve. 
* How many brewers are there per country? what is the most common beer styles per country? what is the total beer production in ton?
- Motivation behind the analysis.
* I want to know what the percentage of the most common beer style is per country in total of the beer production.
- Where in the project your code has been implemented.
* In task 4 
- The design choices you made.
*
- Expected input and output of each function you have defined.
